Marco is a tech-enabled trade lender that provides loans from $25,000 per month to $10 million of collateral free working capital to Latin American small and mid-size businesses by using their trade receivables to mitigate risk. They created a proprietary risk model that assesses risk in real time by processing data. The factoring approach they are using to financing trade, also reduces risk and frees up working capital, i.e. cash, to allow underserved exporters to continue operations. 

Marco Capital, Inc. aka Marco Financial, was founded by Jacob Shoihet and Peter D. Spradling in Miami, Florida at the end of 2019, officially launching their product at the beginning of 2020. The company received $7 million in seed funding from Struck Capital and Antler, and $75 million in a credit facility from Arcadia Funds LLC and Kayyak Ventures. One of their angel investors is Naman Budhdeo, CEO and Co-Founder of Tripstack and FlightNetwork. Other investors are Arpegio, Village Global VC, Flexport Ventures, Tresalia Capital, 342 Capital, Struck Capital, Antler LLC, Florida Funders, and Fox Ventures.

The idea for the company came from the CEO Jacob Shoihet who was born in Uruguay and witnessed his family’s slaughterhouse export business struggle finding financing. Marco is trying to make funding faster for trade companies who typically would need founders that come from wealth or have access to wealth to start up. “Banks don’t like risk, which means businesses spend most of their time trying to get financing rather than increasing sales,” Spradling told TechCrunch. “Banks in Latin America have a saying that ‘they lend money to people who don’t need it.” 

They are focused on import and export companies’ revenue and potential for revenue, rather than the standard 2 years financial statements needed by banks or other financial institutions to prove their standing. The standard lending requirement does not allow trade founders to start their companies, especially female founders who are not as readily considered by banks or do not have the collateral required; 50% of all trade companies get rejected within 90 days of applying.  From their work with PROCOLOMBIA, they have been quoted as saying there’s a $350 billion trade finance market and gap, that if successfully met can create up to 500,000 jobs from just 1% increase in the productivity of exports. 

Marco guarantees funding within 24 hours of approval, and that all applicants will speak to someone at their financial institution within that timeframe. They are currently focused on paperless applications, ensuring their application can be accessed via typeform on mobile phones. 

Currently in the lending space through technological resources Marco is able to reach companies much faster. The major trends in the fintech lending space have been the ease of completing an application through the internet, whether through websites, or apps. The internet has also allowed for easier risk management, with access to a person or company’s profile, financial history, and information within minutes. 

There are currently no competitors in the space, as they are the first financing platform targeting small and medium sized trade companies in the U.S. and Latin America. 

As of 2020, Marco has offered their financing to 20 countries, at around $18 million, well on their way. There are no concrete metrics, but based on recent investments into their growth and offices opening up in Latam and other US cities, I think the investors’ confidence bodes well for how successful they are and will be. 

If I were to advise the company, I would offer a better application process than typeform. Also, given their focus on small trading companies, I would offer other services such as invoicing on a company’s behalf, inventory management, and business guidance. Adding on invoicing will ensure the companies they process the invoices for, get paid, which in turn will help them pay off their loan with Marco. Both the invoicing and inventory management can be done through an app that has a profile for each customer and their order, their order registers against the company’s own inventory and either fulfills it or delays it. If it’s delayed, it sends a message to the factory manager and then to the client. This will ensure better and faster processing and transparency.
